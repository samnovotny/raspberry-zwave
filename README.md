Simplest of Mac OS test harnesses to test calls to a Razberry interface.

The idea being to demystify the complexities of the manuals and start sending simple commands to the device and take it from there. Hopefully the test harness is so trim so as not to introduce any build problems and get started straight away.

Fire up the window and enter the IP of where your device sits on the network and change the port number if you modified the default. 

Hit the first button next to the 'Retrieve all data from Razberry' textfield  (the texfield is intentionally disabled) and if your URL is correct the window will display the device's response.

Once you have mastered that bit, try your luck at sending 'made up' commands (as per the manual) to the device.
